# Time-Machine-Marburg üèõÔ∏è
"Time Machine Marburg" is multimodal historical data structuring project that aims to analyze and organize a complex dataset from the photo archive of Marburg, consisting of historical images, objects, landscapes, maps, portraits, texts and more. Particularly, it involves Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Web Metadata Extraction, transforming a raw archive into a structured dataset as well as separating university-related buildings images for further use by another team, which will create historical storytelling to the anniversary of the university.

## üõ†Ô∏è Reproducing Project Workflow
**Run the complete data processing pipeline**
Follow our notebooks and code to reproduce the full workflow‚Äîfrom downloading raw data and cleaning labels to clustering images and generating structured outputs. All notebooks in hierarchical order you can find in `notebooks/` folder.

## üì¶ Access the Ready-Made Data
**Use the delievered dataset directly**
If you're only interested in using the cleaned and classified data (e.g., for storytelling, visualization, or research), you can explore the final outputs without running the full pipeline. All datasets and their logic described you can find in `datasets/delivery` folder.
