## Description of repository


- **DELIVERY/** - Folder with the most relevant datasets for future teams. It contains all linked dataset and some additional delivered models and pictures
- **datasets_benchmark/** - Folder with benchmark for clustering testing. Inside are folders for different physical objects (e.g. Elisabethkirche or Kliniken) 
- **datasets/** - Folder with all datasets versions, which are described in related README.md file inside folder. dataset_CLEANED_ver2.csv should be used for all further work (objects are structured, missing values are filled)
- **emails/** - Some copies of Prof.Bell's and  Max Gr√ºntgens' emails are here, so they are available for all of us
- **config/** - Folder for functions and illustrations in notebooks. Also include some errors, which arise while working (for future considering see Documentation)
    - **fucntions/columns_converter.py** - function for converting lists of strings into lists of links (are used inside Notebooks)
    - **fucntions/img_downloader.py** - functions for donwloading images (are used inside Notebooks)
